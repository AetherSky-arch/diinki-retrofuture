# Retro-Futuristic Linux Rice

diinki-retrofuture is a retro-futuristic linux rice that revolves around [this](https://diinki.com) youtube
video that I've made; where I teach you how to make this exact rice from scratch. Of course, the github version
has cleaner config files and more comments, so I highly recommend reading the configs and code, and also customizing them as you see fit

This project also includes a GTK3/4 theme which I highly recommend, it makes nemo/nautilus/etc look good with the
rice!

## üìå Installation Steps

Feel free to watch [this part of my video](https://diinki.com), where I skim over how to install this rice;
especially useful if you have ADHD or hate reading...

**I'm assuming you use arch or an arch-based, but the steps would be extremely similar regardless.**

1. `Installation`
   - Run `sudo pacman -S sway wofi waybar nemo nautilus kitty dconf` in your terminal.
   - Run `yay eww` in your terminal (if you also want widgets) (you may need to install yay) (note that you _might_ also need to change the monitor setup for eww, if it doesn't work immediately for you).
   - Install the Maple Mono font, as this font is used a lot in this Linux rice. Move the font-file to `/usr/share/fonts`, then run `fc-cache -f -v` to update all font
   - Run `git clone https://github.com/diinki/diinki-retrofuture` to clone this repo
2. `Config Setup`
   - Copy all folders in the `diinki-retrofuture/config` directory to your local user `.config` directory
     (`~/.config`).
   - Copy the `diinki-retro-dark` folder in `diinki-retrofuture/gtk_theme` to your local user `.themes` directory (`~/.themes`), you may need to create this directory manually if you don't already have it.
   - Use a text editor to edit the sway config-file in `~/.config/sway/config`. You need to edit the config
     to setup your wallpaper and monitor settings. I've commented the file with the steps.
   - Enter `dconf-editor` in your terminal to open up the dconf gui program, use this to set the GTK theme
     to `diinki-retro-dark`, you may also use dconf to set your icon theme and cursor theme.
3. `Creative Liberty`
   - I have commented all config files in a concise and descriptive manner, I recommend reading them and
     editing them as you see fit; you may want to add or change things, such as the keybinds for sway, or
     the fonts used.
   - Feel free to continue reading this document for more details on the design & softwares used.

### ‚å®Ô∏è Key-binds

All key-binds can be find in the sway config file, simply refer to those and edit them if you'd like.

The most important default key-binds are:

- `mod` = the super key, (the windows key, as some people refer to it as). You can re-bind mod to something else if you wish.

- `mod` + `Enter` = launch terminal.
- `mod` + `D` = launch application launcher.
- `mod` + `[any number, 1-9]` = switch focus to the workspace equivalent to the number.
- `mod` + `Shift` + ` [any number, 1-9]` = move the focused window to the workspace equivalent to the number.
- `mod` + `Shift` + ` Space` = toggle floating mode for the focused window.
- `mod` + `Shift` + ` C` = restart eww and all other things such as waybar and eww.
- `mod` + ` Q` = Exit/Kill the focused window.
- `mod` + `F` = toggle full-screen mode for the focused window.
- `mod` + `Right Mouse Button` = re-size a window
- `mod` + `Left Mouse Button` = move a window

### üíæ Toolkit & Software

This rice uses the following tools and softwares:

- `sway` (The window manager)
- `wofi` (Application Launcher)
- `waybar` (Taskbar/Infobar)
- `dconf` (Used to edit gtk themes and cursors, and default softwares used)
- `nemo` or `nautilus` (File explorer).
- `kitty` (The terminal Emulator)
- `themix-oomix` (Used to create the non GTK4 themes.)
- `network-manager-applet` (Used for tray and other nm things, probably installed with your OS by default.)
- `eww` (Widgets)

In the guide, I installed endeavorOS with Gnome, and showed how to switch from gnome
to sway, in order to boot into sway I decided to show how to use the `ly` login
manager, it's not strictly needed, but for the sake of brevity:

- `ly` Login manager that's used.

### üñåÔ∏è Design Language

This Linux-Rice is simple in essence, no massive and complicated config files and designs;
that being said there's quite a lot of thought put into each element in order for them to
follow a **Retro Futuristic design system** that I've made, this includes bespoke wallpapers
that are made to look good with this rice.

Design system descriptions can be found in the `design_system` directory of this repository.

### üé® Color Palette

The main color palette used widely for this rice in both the GTK themes and other components are:

`Core:`

- Accent: `#AC82E9`
- Accent Deep: `#8F56E1`
- Dark: `#141216`
- Lighter Dark `#27232b`
- Foreground: `#d8cab8`
- Complementary Accent: `#c4e881`

`Additional:`

- Warning: `#fcb167`
- Danger: `#fc4649`
- Yellow: `#f3fc7b`
- Green: `#c4e881`
- Blue: `#7b91fc`
- Cyan: `#92fcfa`
- Magenta: `#fc92fc`

### üåÜ Wallpapers:

Wallpapers for this rice can be found in the `wallpapers` directory of this repo.

The wallpapers may be under-saturated , or use completely different yet matching colors
in order to create good background/foreground separation between the UI elements
and the wallpaper.

You may also use `sway-fx` instead of `sway`, which is a fork of `sway` with additional features
such as shadows, rounded edges, and blur.

All Wallpapers included in this repo are bespoke for the rice, made by me. Additional elements may
have been cut-out from other artworks and elements, I've included sources to those elements in case
where I've been able to find them.

### üñãÔ∏è Fonts:

A lot of elements use the Maple Mono font in this rice, it's a good font and so I recommend installing it.
You can edit the font by editing the config files.

You can install the font directly from github, I recommend keeping it relatively up-to-date. Move the font
files to your system `/usr/share/fonts` directory, then update the font cache by running `fc-cache -f -v`

### GTK & Icon Theme:

I recommend using the included GTK theme, however for the icon theme you may pick whichever you like.
